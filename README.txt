Grocery transaction dataset

##About project
This is an implementation of Apriori and FP-Growth Algorithm in Python 3. Both thealgorithms generate the frequent itemsets, association rules, closed and maximal sets for particular values of support and confidence. 

The source code files, along with the dataset csv, are present in the source folder. 

##Implementation
###1. Pre-Processing
A header was added to the csv ranging from 1-32.
###2. Frequent item-set generation using Apriori
###3. Frequent item-set generation using FP-Growth (Faster than apriori)
###4. Association Rule Mining from generated frequent itemsets
